# Student's Skills Evaluation System

## Abstract

There is a critical need to redefine the evaluation process for IT students,
 transcending conventional academic metrics and embracing a holistic assessment
that incorporates various parameters. The current evaluation criteria,
 particularly the stringent 60% academic benchmark, impose limitations
 by restricting opportunities for students and neglecting the recognition
of practical skills. Traditional evaluation systems heavily rely on academic metrics,
 leading to the exclusion of deserving candidates due to the absence of a comprehensive
assessment considering diverse parameters.

This research proposes an Ensemble Method algorithm as a solution,
introducing a holistic evaluation approach. The system provides a
 user-friendly interface for students and a secure dashboard for educators.
The research contributes to a more inclusive evaluation process by considering certifications,
 programming skills, projects, and extracurricular activities such as sports, empowering students
 to showcase their complete skill set. The application leverages the Repo questor API, OCR Technology,
 and Codility API in conjunction with the proposed algorithm, ensuring a comprehensive and well-rounded
 assessment of students’ capabilities. The research demonstrates approximately 87.93% accuracy,
 particularly beneficial for IT students seeking a more inclusive evaluation,
 educators and evaluators desiring a detailed analysis of student progress,
 and organizations aiming to recognize a diverse range of talents and skills in potential candidates.

## Introduction

The evaluation of Information Technology (IT) students has historically depended
 on traditional academic metrics, offering a limited perspective on their capabilities.
 In today’s fast-paced technological environment, IT professionals need a diverse skill
 set that goes beyond textbook knowledge. This research paper introduces a pioneering web
 application designed to redefine the assessment of IT students by moving beyond conventional grading systems.
 It provides a comprehensive and holistic evaluation that considers multiple aspects of a student’s development.

Academic achievements have long been crucial in the job market for evaluating candidates. However,
 the prevalent practice of setting a minimum academic benchmark, often at 60%, has created barriers for many
 talented individuals. This rigid benchmark, meant to assess academic skills, often fails to capture the full
 spectrum of an individual’s abilities.

## Project Goals

The main goal of our research is to develop a user-friendly web application that transforms the evaluation process. This application evaluates a variety of factors, including:

- **Grades**
- **Certifications**
- **Projects**
- **Programming Skills**
- **Extracurricular Activities** (e.g., sports)

This approach offers a more complete and accurate depiction of each student’s abilities, talents, and achievements in the professional world.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows students to input relevant data,
                              such as certifications earned, programming skills acquired,
                              projects completed, and participation in extracurricular activities.

- **Secure Dashboard:** Provides educators and evaluators with access to a secure dashboard,
                         offering a powerful tool to visualize and analyze each student’s progress.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Utilizes the Repo questor API for project assessment,
                               OCR technology for certificate evaluation, and the Codility API
                               for programming tests to evaluate students' performance and skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Repo questor API**: For project assessment.
- **OCR Technology**: For certificate evaluation.
- **Codility API**: For programming tests.
- **Web Scraping**: To collect and analyze data.
